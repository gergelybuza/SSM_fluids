## Spectral submanifold computation and branch continuation in fluid dynamics

Contains a branch continuation package along with an expansion-based tool extracting invariant manifolds. Branch continuation is done via a simple Newton-Raphson procedure, coupled to pseudo-arclength continuation. The invariant manifold computation is based on the parameterization method, and relies crucially on the open-source codes

- Sandia tensor toolbox: https://gitlab.com/tensors/tensor_toolbox.

The general use of this package is demonstrated through a sequence of examples -- these can be found in the main folder, their names should be self-explanatory. The accompanying text can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07898).
